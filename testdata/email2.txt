Hi Nirav, 

Thank you for taking a minute to look at this. I am aware you may receive many emails. 

I am networking with Engineers for a career changing opportunity to be a Software Engineer at Amazon. It's on their Search team which, you may be aware, is going through its biggest growth in Amazon's history. 

Your polyglot-like programming background and past experience with Quality Engineering is what Amazon is looking for so I wanted to reach out and see if you might be interested in an opportunity to work with Amazon here in Seattle, WA? 

I understand relocation is not for everyone, but if you've ever considered moving to the west coast, it would be worth considering a move to Seattle, WA. 

Thanks,

Ian Cocklin
